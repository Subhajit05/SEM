<h3>Matrix Formulation - McArdle and McDonald </h3>

<p>There are such procedures, which allow the expression of the equations of a path diagram as the product of several matrices.</p>

<p> Not only does such an approach allow one to turn a path diagram into a set of path equations with less risk of error, but in fact one need not explicitly write down the path equations at allâ€”one can carry out
the calculation of implied correlations directly via operations on the matrices.</p>

<p> Following methods are popular - 

<ul>

<li>McArdle and McDonald (1984)</li>

<li>Benter-Weeks(1980)</li>

<li>McArdle(1980)</li>

<li>McDonald(1978)</li>

</ul>

From the above diagramme following equations can be written - 
$$C = c * B + a * A + e$$
$$D = a * A + d$$
Now the above equaiton can also be written in matrix form in the folloiwng manner - 

$$A = 0*A + 0*B + 0*C + 0*D$$
$$B = 0*A + 0*B + 0*C + B$$
$$C = a * A + c * B + 0 * C + 0 * D + e$$
$$D = a * A + 0 * B + 0 * C + 0 * D + d$$

<img src= "E:/Mine/Books/IT/R-programming/Outline - R Programming/WD/SEM/Presentation1/Slide22.png">

Now, if the vector of A, B C, D is considered as **v** , the coefficients are considered as **A** and the vector D, B , e and d is considered as **u**, then the above matrix can be written as 

$$v = A * v + u$$

$$v * (I - A) = u$$
$$v = (I - A)^{-1}  u$$
Now the covariance / correlation can be expressed as 

$$\frac{vv^{\prime}}{n} = \frac{(I - A)^{-1} u u{^\prime}(I -A)^{-1{^\prime}}}{n}$$
Now , $u * u^{\prime}$ is another covariance matrix , which can be donated as $S$ , so 

$$C = \frac{v*v{^\prime}}{n} = \frac{(I - A)^{-1} * S * (I -A)^{-1{^\prime}}}{n}$$



McArdle and McDonald (1984) defines the structure of the equation in the following manner -

<ul>

<li>A (for symmetric relations) contains paths.</li>

<li>S (for asymmetric relations) contains correlations (or covariances) and residual variances.</li>

<li>F (for filter matrix) selects out the observed variables from the total set of variables.</li>

<img src = "E:/Mine/Books/IT/R-programming/Outline - R Programming/WD/SEM/Presentation1/Slide22.png">

$$C = F * (I - A)^{-1} * S * (I -A)^{-1{^\prime}} * F{^\prime}$$

where , there are "t" variables out of which "m" are measured -

$A$ is a  (t * t) matrix

$S$ is a (t * t) matrix

$F$ is a (m * t) matrix


<h3>Benter-Weeks Model</h3>

$$\eta = \beta * \eta + \gamma * \xi$$
where, there are "q" no of  DVs and "r" no of IVs are there.

<ul>

<li>$\eta$ is a q * q matrix </li>

<li>$\beta$ is a q * q  matrix </li>

<li>$\gamma$ is a q * r matrix </li>

<li>$\xi$ is a r * 1 matrix </li>

<\ul>

<img src= "E:/Mine/Books/IT/R-programming/Outline - R Programming/WD/SEM/Presentation1/Slide7.png">

<p>In the example, SKISAT, SNOWSAT, FOODSAT, NUMYRS, and DAYSKI are all DVs because they all have at least one line with a single-headed arrow pointing to them. Notice that SKISAT is a latent variable and also a dependent variable.</p>

<p>



In the above model , r = 7 and q = 5

If the above above diagramme is represented in terms of the Benter-Weeks model, it would like
